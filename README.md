![Spacetar Homepage](https://github.com/amdonatusprince/spacetar-on-avalanche/blob/main/src/assets/dashboard-1.png)


## Inspiration
The concept for Spacetar emerged from a profound aspiration to revolutionize mental well-being support. In a world where discussions about mental health are often stifled or limited, we recognized the need for a decentralized solution that could foster a safe, nurturing environment for individuals to openly share their emotions and experiences.

The driving force behind this project was the desire to create a community that not only understands but also celebrates the courage it takes to voice one's thoughts. 

We envisioned Spacetar as a beacon of empathy and connection, where people from all walks of life could come together to embark on a journey of healing and empowerment.
